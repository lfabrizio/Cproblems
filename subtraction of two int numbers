Given two integer number and find the subtraction of them using C program.
In this program, we are reading two integer numbers in variable a and b and assigning the subtraction of a and b in the variable sub.


#include<stdio.h>

int main()
{
	int a,b,sub;

	//Read value of a
	printf("Enter the first no.: ");
	scanf("%d",&a);

	//Read value of b
	printf("Enter the second no.: ");
	scanf("%d",&b);

	//formula of subtraction
	sub= a-b;
	printf("subtract is = %d\n", sub);

	return 0;
}
